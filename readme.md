# Seeking Kotlin Developers - OpenMRS – FHIR

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is seeking Kotlin Developers that can support its efforts in building an Offline-Capable Android Application integrated with enhanced OpenMRS 3.0 FHIR Module.

## How to contribute?
Use [this form](https://forms.office.com/e/n7FrE3vZn4) in case you are interested and available to support our efforts, or if you require more information. Please note that before submitting contributions, you will be asked to accept the ICRC’s terms and conditions.

## Repository
https://github.com/icrc/openmrs-android-fhir

## Context
Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) with little to no internet connectivity in needed  areas are in need of offline capabilities of OpenMRS.
OpenMRS is a collaborative open-source project to develop software to support the delivery of health care in developing countries.

## More details on the project
The aim is to develop an Android application optimized for LMIC healthcare settings, utilizing Google's Open Health Stack for offline functionality. The application will be designed to integrate seamlessly with the enhanced FHIR module of OpenMRS 3.0. This integration will enable efficient data management with capabilities for offline data collection, and two-way synchronization with OpenMRS 3.0 once connectivity is available, improving healthcare delivery in resource-limited settings.
